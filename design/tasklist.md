Things to do
============

Bugs
----
+ Horrendous lag spike when selecting a tile for movement, especially bad when portals are available
+ Capturing a or destroying a base doesn't always 
+ Eliminating a player from a 6 player game reverted the player order back to Player 1

Improvements based on Player feedback
-------------------------------------
+ Add unit inset to show currently selected unit, and unit strength
+ Combat report summary
+ Not clear how to select and move a unit
+ A way to name individual players - pass and play between six people made it hard to track

Suggestions based on Player feedback
------------------------------------
- Split attack strength and health into separate fields
- Add terrain to planets to provide defense
- Add space ports to planets to restrict movement from space to the ground
- Add strategic points on planets that gain players additional resources
- Add asteroids in space that gain players additional resources
- Add colony ship to create bases on other planets
- Add cards to upgrade bases
- Add cards that allow cards to be trashed from the hand
- Add cards that allow free production / deployment of certain units
- Create a zoomable / moveable map
